ðŸ“Š Data Exploration in SQL â€” COVID-19 Cases, Deaths & Vaccinations
Overview
Exploratory analysis of the COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations datasets in SQL Server to understand infection rates, mortality, regional differences, and vaccination progress. 
The work prepares clean, queryable outputs for BI tools (Power BI/Tableau) and demonstrates practical SQL for analytics.

What I did
Profiled core fields (location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population).
Case fatality analysis: total_deaths / total_cases * 100 to estimate mortality risk (country-level and over time).
Infection penetration: total_cases / population * 100 to measure % of population infected; identified highest infection rates by country.
Severity ranking: Calculated max death counts and continent-level totals to compare regional impact.
Global trendlines: Aggregated new_cases and new_deaths by date to track worldwide surges and the global death percentage over time.
Vaccination progress: Joined Deaths and Vaccinations by location+date and built a rolling cumulative sum of new_vaccinations using a window function to approximate % population vaccinated.

Reusable assets:
Built a CTE for readability and step-wise derivations.
Created a temp table for quick ad-hoc exploration.
Published a view (PercentPopulationVaccinated) for downstream visualisations.
Data hygiene: Filtered out non-country aggregates (continent IS NOT NULL) and handled type issues with explicit CAST/CONVERT.

Techniques & SQL Concepts
JOINs, GROUP BY aggregates, window functions (ROW_NUMBER, SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY â€¦ ORDER BY â€¦)), CTEs, temp tables, views, type conversions, date-wise rollups, and ranking.

Outcome
Produced queryable tables/views that surface:
% population infected and case fatality by country/continent
Countries with highest infection rates and highest deaths
Global daily trendlines for cases and deaths
Cumulative vaccinations and % of population vaccinated over time
These outputs feed cleanly into BI dashboards for monitoring spread, severity, and vaccination impact.
